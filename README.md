### 🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++

A simple, well-structured implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using C++. This project demonstrates how to insert, delete, search, and traverse nodes in a BST, along with memory cleanup using destructors.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Insert nodes
- ✅ Delete nodes (supports all 3 cases)
- ✅ Search for a value
- ✅ In-order traversal
- ✅ Pre-order traversal
- ✅ Post-order traversal
- ✅ Find minimum and maximum values
- ✅ Memory cleanup using recursive destructor (`~BinarySearchTree`)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Binary Search Tree structure
- Recursion
- Tree traversal techniques
- Dynamic memory management
- Object-oriented design in C++
- Object-oriented programing in C++

---

## 🛠️ Usage

You’ll be prompted to:
- Display traversals
- Search for a number
- Delete a node
- Display the tree after deletion

## 📂 Code Structure

| Function         | Description                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Insert(int)`    | Inserts a value into the BST              |
| `Delete(int)`    | Deletes a value from the BST              |
| `Search(int)`    | Returns `true` if value exists            |
| `Min()` / `Max()`| Returns the node with minimum/maximum     |
| `PreOrder()`     | Prints nodes in pre-order (Root-L-R)      |
| `InOrder()`      | Prints nodes in in-order (L-Root-R)       |
| `PostOrder()`    | Prints nodes in post-order (L-R-Root)     |
| `~BinarySearchTree()` | Clears all nodes on destruction     |
